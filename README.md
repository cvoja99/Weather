## About

This is a rewrite of the exisiting application from the ground up, using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [MUI](https://mui.com/) version 5.

For building the project, we use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a development server and a bundler, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - current version, and [pnPM](https://pnpm.io/) for package management. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is used to install and keep the current NodeJS version up to date, and to also separate it from the system installation.


### Important notices

To run the project in development mode, you should run:
pnpm dev

To build the project, you should run:
